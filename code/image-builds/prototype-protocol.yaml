# Selected notebooks configuration,  each list item is a set of

# specified in the image spec header.

  # TD1: is it efficient to duplicate mast_notebooks like this?
  # Writing a more sophisticated protocol to handle sub_subdirs
  # is not needed for an MVP, or maybe ever. Just food for thought.

# ---
# It will be understood that directories are recursively included
# but need only be one level deep if desired.
# They are assumed to be relative extensions of root_nb_directory.

# ---
# To define the basic environment, the simplest form is the
# "python_version" directive which merely defines the Python version.
# Any other tools required to build Python extensions (e.g. gcc or
# lapack or fftw or cython) can be chosen arbitrarily by the
# science-platform-images build system.
#
# A requirements.txt file at any level of the specified directories
#   will be included in the union of image requirements and for the
#   purposes of the build renamed to something which identifies its
#   directory-of-origin
#
# include_subdirs *could* default to [ . ]
# exclude_subdirs *could* default to []
#
# root_nb_directory can be specified in the image_spec_header as default
#   or for each directory block as an override.
# root_nb_directory defaults to "" meaning top-of-repo (could also be /)
#
# ---
# Planned outputs from science-platform-images:
# 1. Comprehensive pip package list  (pip-tools output)
# 2. Notebook package union, with requirements resolution
# 3. Full conda spec for environment which will include Python + base tools
#
