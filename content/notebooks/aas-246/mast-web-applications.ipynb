For simple queries, the web applications are often faster and easier to use than application program interfaces (APIs). \n",

    "Scientists access MAST data in a variety of ways. Some write programs in the language of their choosing which requires calling APIs. Some write notebooks which allows them to explore the data more interactively than with a traditional programming language. Notebooks still require learning how to use the APIs. Some go to the web applications first because they are easy to use and allow you to explore what is available."
