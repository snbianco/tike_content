    "Dr. Nefarious is trying to corrupt the archive by overwhelming it with irrelevant data. To stop him, you’ll need to isolate the scientifically valuable regions of massive astronomical datasets—zooming in on stars, galaxies, and transient events with precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll learn how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract cutouts from FITS images using the `FITSCutout` class.\n",
    "- Create cutouts from TESS full-frame images using the `TessFootprintCutout` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cutout you generate brings us one step closer to locking Dr. Nefarious out and securing the archive’s future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time is ticking. Let’s dive in.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Imports\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses the following packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `astrocut` for creating cutouts from astronomical images.\n",
    "- `astropy` for handling FITS files and coordinates.\n",
    "- `astroquery.mast` for identifying TESS sectors.\n",
    "- `lightkurve` for visualizing TESS data.\n",
    "- `matplotlib` for visualizing the cutouts."

    "In this section, we will learn how to create cutouts of FITS images using the `astrocut` library. The Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) is a standard format for astronomical data. Astrocut can generate cutouts from FITS files and return the results in memory or as a written file, depending on the user’s preference.\n",

    "Let's create a cutout of some stack images from the Pan-STARRS survey. These images are of the same region of the sky, but they use three different broadband filters: i, r, and g. We will create a square cutout around Stephan's Quintet, a visual grouping of five galaxies located in the Pegasus constellation.\n",
