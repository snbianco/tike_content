    "Welcome! This tutorial details how to use the `astroquery.mast` module to find mission-specific observations. We will be focusing on data from the [Hubble Space Telescope (HST)](https://science.nasa.gov/mission/hubble/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Today's data come from the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST)](https://archive.stsci.edu/), which hosts publicly accessible data products from space telescopes including HST. The module `astroquery.mast` supports querying these data products, and its API is available [here](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mast/mast.html). We will specifically focus on the MastMissions class `astroquery.mast.MastMissions` to query for observations and metadata from the HST."

Currently, `MastMissions` supports 4 mission collections:\n",
