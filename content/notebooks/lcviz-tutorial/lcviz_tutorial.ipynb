    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this notebook we will be exploring the use of the [LCviz](https://github.com/spacetelescope/lcviz) (light curve visualization and analysis) tool for investigating time series observations of a transiting exoplanet. LCviz is built on the [Jdaviz](https://github.com/spacetelescope/jdaviz/) data analysis and visualization tool and additionally relies heavily on the [lightkurve](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve) and [astropy](https://github.com/astropy/astropy) packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we will be using LCviz to look at a Kepler long cadence light curve of HAT-P-11, a K4V host to a transiting hot Neptune with a 4.8 day period, and a stellar rotation period of 29 days ([Morris et al. 2014](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...846...99M/abstract))."
